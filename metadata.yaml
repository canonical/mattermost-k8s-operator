  A [Juju](https://juju.is/) [charm](https://juju.is/docs/olm/charmed-operators)
  deploying and managing [Mattermost](https://mattermost.com/) on Kubernetes.
  Mattermost is an open-source, self-hostable online chat service with file sharing,
  search and integrations.

  This charm simplifies initial deployment and “day N” operations of Mattermost
  on Kubernetes, such as scaling the number of instances and clustering, access
  to S3 and more. It allows for deployment on many different Kubernetes
  platforms, from [MicroK8s](https://microk8s.io) to
  [Charmed Kubernetes](https://ubuntu.com/kubernetes/charmed-k8s) to public cloud
  Kubernetes offerings.

  As such, the charm makes it easy for those looking to take control of their own
  chat system whilst keeping operations simple, and gives them the freedom to
  deploy on the Kubernetes platform of their choice.

  For DevOps or SRE teams this charm will make operating Mattermost simple and
  straightforward through Juju’s clean interface. It will allow easy deployment
  into multiple environments for testing changes, and supports scaling out for
  enterprise deployments.
